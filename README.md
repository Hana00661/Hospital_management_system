# Hospital Management System

The Hospital Management System is designed for developing countries to simplify and enhance healthcare operations for hospitals and clinics.
In developing countries, hospital treatment costs are usually high for patients because the doctor needs many assistants to be able to follow up on all the patients.  

This application helps the doctor manage all patient follow-up processes, starting from confirming payments, through laboratory tests, and ending with treatment. This results in the hospital having to reduce the administrative staff, which leads to lower prices in hospitals, taking into account limited-income, distressed and suffering patients.  

With functionalities such as patient and doctor registration, appointment scheduling, lab test result tracking, and prescription management, it provides a user-friendly platform that simplifies patient access to medical services and improves the efficiency of healthcare professionals' workflows.  

Tailored for healthcare institutions seeking a modern, efficient solution, this system empowers patients while giving doctors powerful tools for managing appointments and patient care with lower costs.
